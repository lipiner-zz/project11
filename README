# project11 #
#############
The project parses a jack file (or all jack files in a given directory) written in jack language to a compiled
vm file. The project consists on the following files:

- VMWirter.py - writes each cm command to the output stream given when initializing the object
- JackTokenizer.py- Parses the jack code to parts: removes all comments and white space from the input stream, and
    breaks it into jack language tokens, as specified by the Jack grammar.
- CompilationEngine.py- Builds the parsed structure of the jack code according to the given tokens from the tokenizer
    and writes it to an vm file using the VMWriter.
- JackCompiler- Runs the program. Gets the jack file/directory and produces the matching vm code files.
- SymbolTable- contains all the known variable in the current subroutine.
- Variable- contains all the variable's information: its name, type, kind and index in the segment.
